title: CSV file

You can download the full set of Machin-like formulae included on this website as
a CSV (commas-separated variable) file.
This file is available at [{{url}}/formulae.csv](/formulae.csv)

The first row of the CSV file is <code>{{csv-first-line}}</code>. Each subsequent line
represents one formula for pi, with the fields given in the first line separated by commas.

The CSV file includes the compact formula for each Machin-like formula. In this compact notation,
<code>a[b]</code> represents \(a\arctan(1/b)\). For example, the compact formula
<code>4[5] - 16[239]</code> represents Machin's formula, ie
$$\pi=4\arctan\left(\frac15\right)-16\arctan\left(\frac1{239}\right)$$
