## Citing machin-like.org

The code used to generate this website is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mscroggs/machin)

On each of the Machin-like formula pages, you can find citations for the formula. These should be
cited when using a given formula. If you wish to cite this website, you can use the following BibTeX:

```
@misc{machin-like.org,
       AUTHOR = {{{list contributors|bibtex}}},
        TITLE = {Machin-like formulae},
         YEAR = {{{{date:Y}}}},
 HOWPUBLISHED = {\url{https://machin-like.org}},
         NOTE = {[Online; accessed {{date:D-M-Y}}]}
}
```

This will create a reference along the lines of:

<ul class='citations'>
<li>{{list contributors|citation}}. <i>Machin-like formulae</i>, {{date:Y}}, <a href='https://machin-like.org'>https://machin-like.org</a> [Online; accessed: {{date:D-M-Y}}].</li>
