Machin's formula ([M000001](/M000001)) is a formula for &pi; that was discovered by John Machin in 1706:
$$\pi=4\arctan\left(\frac15\right)-16\arctan\left(\frac1{239}\right)$$
There are a huge number of Machin-like formulae that have since been discovered, all of which
are of the form:
$$\pi=a_0\arctan(b_0)+a_1\arctan(b_1)+a_2\arctan(b_2)+\dots$$
