[Machin's formula (M000001)](/M000001) is a formula for &pi; that was discovered by John Machin in 1706:
$$\pi=4\arctan\left(\frac15\right)-16\arctan\left(\frac1{239}\right)$$
There are a huge number of Machin-like formulae that have since been discovered, all of which
are of the form:
$$\pi=a_0\arctan(b_0)+a_1\arctan(b_1)+a_2\arctan(b_2)+\dots$$
where the \(a\)s and \(b\)s are rational numbers.

## Machin-like formulae
On the page for each Machin-like formula, you will find information about the formula, including:

* The formula in compact notation where <code>a[b]</code> represents \(a\arctan(1/b)\).
* [Lehmer's measure](machin-like.md#Lehmers-measure).
* References where the formula was first found.
