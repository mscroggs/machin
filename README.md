# Machin-like formulae

[Machin's formula](https://machin-like.org/M000000001) is a formula for π that was discovered by John Machin in 1706:
π = 16 arctan(1/5) - 4 arctan(1/239).

There are a huge number of Machin-like formulae that have since been discovered. This repository
contains a large collection of Machin-like formulae and code to create the encyclopedia
website [machin-like.org](https://machin-like.org) that includes information about these
formulae.
